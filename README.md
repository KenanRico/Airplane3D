# Airplane3D

This is an 3D flight simulator implemented in OpenGL with c++ and GLFW. The objective is a finished flight simulator that offers:
1 - realistic physics
2 - realistic/professional flight control and mechanisms
3 - multiple flight sceneries
4 - combat system
5 - GUI

Milestones:
1 - Overall framework (GL loader, process resource menagement, event handler, game loop design, memory management)
2 - Low level rendering framework (GPU buffer objects, array objects, shaders)
3 - Vertex transformation mechanisms (Object transformations, Coordinate system, cameras)
4 - OOP hierarchy (object hierarchy, camera hierarchy)
5 - Physics/control refinement (physics, flight rotation, collision, combat) 

6 - Object refinement (textures, model loading, lighting) <----------------------------------------------current milestone
7 - environment (skybox, audio)
8 - GUI design
